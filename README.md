# Ladder ðŸªœ
Ladder simplifies role and permission management for your Laravel project by avoiding storing everything in the database. 
Inspired by [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/features/teams.html#roles-permissions), 
it offers a static approach, reducing queries and ensuring immutability for easy modifications.

## Install
> This package requires Laravel 10 and above.
```bash
composer require eneadm/ladder
```

Once Ladder is installed, create a new LadderServiceProvider to manage roles and permissions. 
You can do so effortlessly with this command:

```bash
php artisan ladder:install
```

Lastly, execute the `migration` command to create a single pivot `user_role` table, assigning roles to users.

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Use

Before using Ladder add the `HasRoles` trait to your `App\Models\User` model. 
By doing so this trait will provide the necessary methods to manage roles and permissions.

```php
use Ladder\HasRoles;
 
class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasRoles;
}
```

### `HasRoles` trait in detail

```php
// Access all of user's roles...
$user->roles : Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection

// Determine if the user has the given role... 
$user->hasRole($role) : bool

// Access all permissions for a given role belonging to the user...
$user->rolePermissions($role) : array

// Access all permissions belonging to the user...
$user->permissions() : Illuminate\Support\Collection

// Determine if the user role has a given permission...
$user->hasRolePermission($role, $permission) : bool

// Determine if the user has a given permission...
$user->hasPermission($permission) : bool
```
> All method arguments can accept string, array, Collection or Enum if desired. 
> For optimal performance, it is advisable to use array or Collection as arguments when handling multiple entries.

### Roles & Permissions
Users can receive roles with permissions defined in `App\Providers\LadderServiceProvider` using `Ladder::role` method. This involves specifying a role's slug, name, permissions, and description. For instance, in a blog app, role definitions could be:
```php
Ladder::role('admin', 'Administrator', [
    'post:read',
    'post:create',
    'post:update',
    'post:delete',
])->description('Administrator users can perform any action.');

Ladder::role('editor', 'Editor', [
    'post:read',
    'post:create',
    'post:update',
])->description('Editor users have the ability to read, create, and update posts.');
```

### Assign Roles
You may assign roles to the user using the `roles` relationship that is provided by the `Ladder\HasRoles` trait:
```php
use App\Models\User;

$user = User::find(1);

$user->roles()->updateOrCreate(['role' => 'admin']);
```

Alternatively, you may use the `assignRole` method to assign a role to the user:
```php
use App\Models\User;

$user = User::find(1);

$user->assignRole('admin');
```

### Multi Tenancy
Ladder provides the ability to assign roles based on a tenant. This is useful when you have multiple tenants and need to assign roles to users based on the tenant they belong to.

It's important to note, that a user can have multiple roles, and each role can be assigned to multiple tenants.
Additionally, a role can be null / unscoped, by default giving the user access to that role, regardless of the tenant.

#### Assigning tenancy based roles

You may assign tenant based roles to the user using the `roles` relationship that is provided by
the `Ladder\HasRoles` trait, with the addition of a `tenant` flag. A tenant can be a string, or an integer.

```php
use App\Models\User;

$user = User::find(1);

$user->roles()->updateOrCreate(['role' => 'admin', 'tenant' => 1]);

// OR

$user->assignRole('admin', 1);

```

#### Checking tenancy based roles

You may check if a user has a tenant based role using the `forTenant()` helper method.

```php
use App\Models\User;

$user = User::find(1);

$user->forTenant('tenant_2')->hasPermission('read');
```

Or, alternatively you can use the Ladder's global instance (within middleware, for example), to check if a user has a tenant based role.

```php
use Ladder\Ladder;
use App\Models\User;

Ladder::setTenant('tenant_1');

$user->hasPermission('read'); // will automatically scope by tenant_1

```

### Authorization
For request authorization, utilize the `Ladder\HasRoles` trait's hasPermission method to check user's role permissions. Generally, verifying granular permissions is more important than roles. Roles group permissions and are mainly for presentation. Use the `hasPermission` method within authorization policies.
```php
/**
 * Determine whether the user can update a post.
 */
public function update(User $user, Post $post): bool
{
    return $user->hasPermission('post:update');
}
```
